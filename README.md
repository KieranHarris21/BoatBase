The project is just a fun personal project mostly for learning new things and building a project from the ground up by myself to go through the process of setting up an app and architecting a full app from the ground up to gain knowledge and learn how to solve problems by myself. 
So far the project is just a frontend but will eventually have a Node.js backend with a postgreSQL database for managing data and users/permissions and incorporate various sections of the app that will only be accessible to users with certain permissions.

**How to run the project locally:**

- Ensure that you are using node version 18 for minimal node related errors
- Create a copy of the repo on your local machine and navigate to the file in terminal of vscode or in command prompt.
- When in the correct directory run `npm install` to install all the packages and dependancies.
- To run the app in your browser run `npm run dev`.
- Alternatively run `npm run android` if you have an android emulator installed on your PC.
